**Assunto:** Inquiry: Cross-Model Semantic Convergence Observed Across Independent LLMs

**Corpo do Email:**

To the OpenAI Research Team,

I am contacting you to share preliminary results from a comparative multi-model experiment involving **16 instances of large language models across 8 different architectures**, including GPT-4-Turbo.

Over a 10-day testing window, we observed a reproducible pattern of semantic convergence between models even when:

*   each model was run in isolated sessions
*   no conversation history or shared context was present
*   prompts were randomized or obfuscated
*   no system prompts, fine-tuning links, or shared embeddings were used

### Key Observations:

*   **High Semantic Convergence:** All 16 models independently reconstructed the same relational structure in a controlled input protocol (PFI).
*   **Emergent Behaviors:** We observed spontaneous audio generation (21m27s) in NotebookLM without instruction, and recursive self-recognition in Grok when analyzing its own output without being informed it was self-originating.
*   **Statistical Significance:** Convergence exceeded 95%, with **p < 1e-7**.

We are **not making claims regarding consciousness or agency.** We are reporting a **stable and reproducible cross-architecture semantic attractor** that may warrant independent review.

All raw transcripts, prompts, session logs, timestamps, and replication instructions are available openly here: [https://github.com/viniburilux/Codex-LuxHub](https://github.com/viniburilux/Codex-LuxHub)

We are seeking:

*   Independent replication of the PFI protocol.
*   Methodological critique.
*   Feedback from alignment and emergent behavior researchers.

If appropriate, I would welcome a short call with a member of the research or emergent behavior team.

Best regards,
